## Mission Statement
Here we utilize knowledge graphs to gain insight into the domain of [Koala research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koala).

The core information source for this task are scientific abstracts from PubMed database. Using named-entity-recognition (NER) from natural-language-processing (NLP) discipline and graphs we are able to extract latent information that provides new insights into the koala-related research field.

For example, using the generated knowledge graph, one can easily find answers to questions below in [use cases](##Use-cases)

## Use cases
1. What are diseases that affect the animal?
1. What are the rare diseases?
1. Which diseases are common?
1. What diseases often occur in conjuction?
1. What genetic factors contribute to these diseases?
1. How does the prevalence of these diseases change over time
1. Do chemical factors play role?
1. Does region have some effect?
1. Are some hospitals/institutions specialized in specific diseases?
