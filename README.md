# POC - KOALA INSIGHTS

## Mission Statement
Here we utilize knowledge graphs to gain insight into the domain of ???

The core information source is for this task are scientific abstracts from PubMed database. Using NLP-NER and graphs we are able to extract latent information.

## Overview

1. [Scraping PubMed](#Mission-Statement)
1. [Data preprocessing/cleaning](#Data-preprocessing)
1. [Data enrichment (NER)](#Data-enrichment-(NER))
1. [Neo4j graph creation](#Neo4j-graph-creation)
1. [Use-case testing on graph](#Use-case-testing)

## Use cases
1. What are diseases that affect the animal?
1. What are the rare diseases?
1. Which diseases are common?
1. What diseases often occur in conjuction?
1. What genetic factors contribute to these diseases?
1. How does the prevalence of these diseases change over time
1. Do chemical factors play role?
1. Does region have some effect?
1. Are some hospitals/institutions specialized in specific diseases?
